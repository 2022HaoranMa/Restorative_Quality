# Restorative_Quality
the following paper: Assessment of attention restoration quality on a college campus: A machine learning-based approach.
we propose a machine learning (ML)-based method for high-resolution, large-scale assessment of the restorative qualities of campus environments using Street View Images (SVIs).
